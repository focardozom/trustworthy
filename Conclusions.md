# What did we learn?

* Trustworthy function is not linear. It depends on multiple parameters (braggers, deniers, and prevalence of drug use)
* To have braggers is different than to have deniers in our sample. They both affect trust in different ways.
* The actual prevalence really matters in our belief of the student responses. 
* There are multiple ways to control the liars (i.e., using a fake drug, granting anonymity, checking for consistency, etc.) to minimize the impact of liars in your survey, so use it!.
