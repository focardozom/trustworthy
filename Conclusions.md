## What can we do?

As you can see, **braggers** and **deniers** impact the trust in student responses. However, there are some things you can do to minimize the impact:

* Control the liars. For example, you can include a fake drug. Estimate the prevalence and then use it to calculate your trust in student responses.

* Grant anonymity. Provide an environment where the students are comfortable telling you the truth. 

* Check for consistency in the student's responses. For example, do the student say they used alcohol in the last month but not in the last year?


## What did we learn?

* Trustworthy depends on multiple parameters (braggers, deniers, and prevalence of drug use).
* **Braggers** and **deniers** affect trust in different ways.
* The actual prevalence matters in our belief of the student responses.
