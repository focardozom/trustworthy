To minimize the impact of reporting biases on the trustworthiness of student responses, there are a few strategies that can be employed:

1. Control for braggers by including a fake drug and estimating its prevalence. This can help to better understand the level of reporting bias present in the data.

1. Grant anonymity to encourage students to be more honest in their responses. Providing a safe and confidential environment can help to reduce the fear of stigma or consequences that may discourage some students from being truthful.

1. Check for consistency in student responses. If there are inconsistencies in a student's responses, it may be an indication of reporting bias.

Overall, it is important to recognize that trustworthiness depends on multiple factors, including the presence of braggers and deniers, and the prevalence of drug use. By understanding these factors and taking steps to minimize the impact of reporting biases, researchers can increase the confidence in their findings.
