# What can we do?

As you can see, braggers and deniers have an effect on our trust in student responses. Something you can do to control their impact are:

* Control the liars. For example, you can include a fake drug. Estimate the prevalence and then used it to calculate your trust in student responses.

* Grant anonymity. Provide an environment in which the students are comfortable to telling you the truth. 

* Check for consistency in the students responses. For example, do the student say they uses alcohol in the last month but not in the last year?



# What did we learn?

* Trustworthy depends on multiple parameters (braggers, deniers, and prevalence of drug use).
* Braggers and deniers affect trust in different ways.
* The actual prevalence really matters in our belief of the student responses.
