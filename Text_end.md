By replacing the variables of interest:  

* **P(A|B)** = Drug use, given they say yes in the questionnaire.
* **P(B|A)** = Say yes given that they have used drugs.
* **P(A)** = Drug use prevalence.
* **P(B)** = Say yes in the questionnaire.

We present two simulated scenarios to understand how trust in student responses changes based on the proportion of **braggers**, **deniers**, and the **Prevalence of alcohol use**.
