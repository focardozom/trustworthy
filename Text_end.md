By replacing the variables of interest:  

* **P(A|B)** = Drug use, given they say yes in the questionnaire.
* **P(B|A)** = Say yes given that they have used drugs.
* **P(A)** = Drug use prevalence.
* **P(B)** = Say yes in the questionnaire.

We present two simulated scenarios to understand how the trustworthiness of student responses changes based on the proportions of **braggers**, **deniers**, and the **prevalence of alcohol use**. By analyzing these simulated scenarios, we can gain insight into how these factors can influence the confidence that can be placed in self-reported data on drug use in adolescents.
